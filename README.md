```python
print("Hi world. I am Hari!")
```
🚗 I'm an Automotive Engineer who accidentally drove into the world of code.  
🐍 I only speak Python – other languages like Java, C, R, or JavaScript? No thanks, my brain crashes.  
💬 Python feels like writing English... so here I am, typing paragraphs that sometimes run!

## 🧠 My Coding Journey

💸 Spent 5 Euros on the ChatGPT API – now I'm coding like a mad scientist with LangChain.  
🤖 I build little Python bots that sometimes work... and sometimes take a nap.  
⚙️ Most of my projects are held together by hope, print statements, and late-night debugging.

## 😂 If you find broken code

Please **laugh out loud** – seriously.  
Your laughter powers my motivation to fix bugs and get better.  
Every `SyntaxError` is just a plot twist in my coding story.
