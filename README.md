🚗 Automotive Engineer trying to drive into the coding world (sometimes into walls).
🐍 Only speaks Python – other languages like Java, C, R, and JavaScript scare me.
💬 Python feels like writing a paragraph... so here I am, writing code like a story!
🧠 Still learning – if you find broken code, please laugh. It actually motivates me 😄
🔧 Building stuff slowly but surely. One line of code at a time.
